blackjack vs computer. computer as house and player as player. 
person closest to 21 not over but under either 21 or lower wins. but sum must be higher then house. house stands on 17 and above always
buttons for hit and stand. stand causing your cards to be locked and hit causing a random card number to be given to you. maybe even add a betting function to the whole system
